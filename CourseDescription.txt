Note: All attendee’s will be eligible to receive a free $50 Amazon AWS credit
after the class to encourage continued exploration of the big data concepts
learned.

Description: 
Have you ever wondered what Big Data is all about?  This class is
an introductory course to the MapReduce distributed programming model that will
let you analyze and process large datasets.  You will take part in a hands-on
demonstration of using Hadoop MapReduce alongside the Hadoop Distributed File
system and learn how to quickly and easily deploy your application using Amazon
Web Services (no need for your own server farm!)

If time permits, you will be challenged to ‘take on the Greeks’  and see if you
can use the MapReduce framework to calculate a better precision of Pi!  In this
approach, a short discussion of how to perform a distributed Monte-Carlo
simulation will entail.  If you don’t finish, you can use your free AWS-credit
to continue at home.

Skills/Requirements: 
•  Basic to intermediate scripting or programming skills
required (any of: Perl, Python, Java, C) 
•  Bring your own wifi-capable laptop
(web-browser and text-editor required).  If you can not bring a computer, please
contact us ahead of time as we might be able to supply one for you with advanced
notice
